## When Training Doesn’t Work: The Hidden Problem ##

You: _“We need a course on this topic.”_<br />
Me: _“What makes you think we need this course?”_

People often find my question frustrating&mdash;especially when the request seems clear and straightforward. It can seem like a waste of time to pause and unpack *why* learning is needed, rather than jumping straight to what the training should cover.

But I ask the question to uncover a hidden problem with the request: *when we build training around content, we miss the opportunity to design solutions*.

Courses built around a topic often fall short&mdash;not because the content is wrong, but because they skip a critical step: defining the specific problem the learning is meant to solve&mdash;what you want learners to know and be able to do that they can’t already, and why those outcomes matter to them.

Once we’re designing solutions, everything else falls into place. We can create focused learning activities, curate purposeful content, and build diagnostic assessments that lead to meaningful, lasting change.
