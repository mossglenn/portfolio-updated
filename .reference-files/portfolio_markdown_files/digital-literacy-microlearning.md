## Bridging the Digital Divide for Research Participation—Safely

For many, engaging with online platforms is second nature—but for individuals with low digital literacy, it can be a barrier that comes with unexpected risks. When the All of Us Research Program expanded its digital-first approach, they also recognized a responsibility: providing accessible training to help individuals navigate digital spaces safely.

## Background & Design Challenge

📍 **How do you enable digital participation for individuals who lack the digital literacy skills to engage with an online platform?**

The All of Us Research Program is building one of the largest health databases in history to advance precision medicine. To achieve this, the program depends on a digital platform for participant engagement, including informed consent. However, a fundamental challenge emerged:

❌ **Many individuals lacked the skills to safely engage online.**  
For many potential participants—especially those from communities historically underrepresented in medical research—the program’s digital-first approach created an unintentional barrier to access. Many individuals lacked experience navigating web-based forms, managing digital consent, or recognizing online security risks.

❌ **Without support, participation was at risk.**  
Potential participants struggled to complete onboarding steps, access research updates, and safeguard personal information in digital spaces.

To mitigate this barrier, All of Us partnered with IDstudio at the National All of Us Program Center (NAPC) to design a learner-centered solution that would make digital participation more accessible and safe. However, rather than distributing this training directly through participant channels, the program made it publicly available so that staff could direct learners to it as a resource.

## The Solution: A Microlearning Series Built for Low-Digital-Literacy Learners

A flexible, self-guided microlearning series was developed to help individuals build digital skills at their own pace. By integrating interactive videos, scenario-based learning, and multilingual resources, this solution empowered learners to safely and confidently engage with digital tools and online health resources—ensuring that lack of technical experience didn’t stand in the way of health equity or personal security.

### ✏️ My Role

🎯 Managed all aspects of instructional design from concept to execution  
🎯 Ensured 508-compliance, multilingual accessibility, and cultural relevance  
🎯 Collaborated with SMEs, community organizations, and program leadership

## 🧠 Instructional Design Approach

To ensure digital literacy training was both effective and accessible, I used a learner-centered approach to address key barriers while maximizing engagement.

### ✅ Helper Enabled

Working with public librarians, who are an important resource for people with low digital literacy, my design called for “helper” instructions to appear alongside the plain language instructions aimed at the learner. These additional instructions provided context and support for a person with higher digital literacy to help the learner get started.

### ✅ Simple Navigation

To reduce the cognitive load for learners less confident using web browsers, all of the navigation within the learning material was included within the bounds of the material itself. Even if the learner needed someone else’s help getting to the content, they would be able to engage with the content independently.

### ✅ Microlearning Modules

To accommodate low-digital-literacy users, I developed short, digestible learning activities that can be accessed easily on any device with a simple web address. Learners can find the exact skills they want to build and engage with the content at their own pace.

### ✅ Follow-along Interactive Video

To reduce the cognitive load when learning more complex digital skills, some modules contained an interactive video of a screen capture demonstrating that skill. The video automatically paused at each step, allowing the learner to complete the action before continuing. When a step required making a choice, the video branched to precisely guide the learner. This method simplified complex skills by allowing learners to focus on each step at their own pace.

### ✅ Scenario-Based Learning

To reinforce practical application and build confidence, I incorporated real-world interactive case studies. Learners received immediate feedback while practicing digital skills in response to common digital challenges.

### ✅ Multilingual & Culturally Responsive Content

Recognizing the diversity of participants, I ensured the training was available in multiple languages (English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, and Arabic). I worked with stakeholders and community representatives to localize examples to make the content relevant to different communities.

### ✅ 508-Compliance & Accessibility

In addition to the basic 508 compliance required for federal projects, I designed additional levels of simplified navigation, screen reader-friendly formatting, and visual elements usable by low-vision learners. These features ensured that learners of all ages and abilities have equitable access to all learning activities.

By integrating these strategies, I developed a training experience that was accessible, engaging, and adaptable to the diverse needs of participants.
