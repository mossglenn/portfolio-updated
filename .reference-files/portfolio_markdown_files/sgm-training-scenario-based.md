## 🔍 Building Confidence for Inclusive Engagement

Even well-intentioned professionals can hesitate when engaging with **Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) communities**—not out of unwillingness, but out of **uncertainty**. _What if I say the wrong thing? What if I unintentionally offend?_ This hesitation can create barriers to **meaningful, affirming interactions** and, in turn, reinforce the **exclusion** that SGM individuals have long faced in **research and healthcare**.

The **SGM Cultural Competency and Humility Training** was developed to **bridge this confidence gap**, equipping **All of Us Research Program staff** with the **knowledge and practical skills** to engage **inclusively, responsively, and with cultural humility**. More than just an **awareness course**, this training empowered learners to **navigate real-world interactions** with **sensitivity and authenticity**.

## 🔹 The Challenge: Moving Beyond Awareness to Meaningful Action

As one of the **communities historically underrepresented in biomedical research**, SGM individuals face **systemic barriers to participation**. The **All of Us Research Program** recognized that fostering **trust and engagement** required more than just **policy changes**—it required **intentional, affirming interactions** at every touchpoint.

A **learning needs assessment** identified three key challenges:

❌ **Limited Awareness of SGM Identities** – Many staff members **lacked foundational knowledge** of SGM terminology, lived experiences, and the **specific barriers** these communities face in **research and healthcare**.

❌ **Lack of Confidence in Engaging with SGM Communities** – Engagement professionals often **hesitated when interacting with SGM individuals**, fearing they might **say the wrong thing** or fail to respond in a **culturally affirming way**.

❌ **Systemic Barriers to SGM Research Participation** – SGM individuals have been **historically underrepresented** in biomedical research, leading to **disparities in healthcare outcomes**. Overcoming this history required more than just **recruitment efforts**—it required **building trust through respectful, informed, and affirming engagement**.

## ✅ The Solution: A Multi-Layered, Interactive Learning Experience

To address these challenges, I led the **design and development** of an **interactive training program** that went beyond static cultural competency checklists. The training provided learners with:

✅ **Practical, scenario-based strategies** to navigate real-world interactions confidently  
✅ A focus on **cultural humility**, emphasizing **ongoing learning and self-awareness**  
✅ **Authentic narratives** from SGM individuals, ensuring the training reflected **lived experiences**

By integrating **interactive learning, stakeholder collaboration, and real-world application**, this training shifted the focus from **theoretical awareness to practical, inclusive engagement**—giving learners the **confidence to foster meaningful and affirming interactions** with SGM individuals.
