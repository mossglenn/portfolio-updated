# Bridging Research, Instructional Design, and Stakeholder Needs

Complex research and innovation hold enormous potential, but theyâ€™re only impactful when **researchers, educators, and stakeholders** can understand, apply, and act on them. My work focuses on **translating technical research into structured learning tools** that help researchers **navigate study design, write grant proposals, and bring innovations to market**. By breaking down complexity and structuring content for clarity, I help researchers move from **ideas to execution with confidence**.
