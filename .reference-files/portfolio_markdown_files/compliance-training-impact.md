## 🔍 Transforming Compliance Training into Ethical Action

Most researchers see compliance training as just another bureaucratic hurdle—something to check off a list before moving on. But what if training could do more? What if, instead of just enforcing rules, it could **inspire researchers to uphold ethical data practices and protect participant trust**?

---

## Background & Design Challenge

At the heart of the **All of Us Research Program** is a core belief: **participants and researchers are equal partners in discovery**. To uphold this principle, the program required researchers to **fully understand their role in protecting privacy and preventing unethical research activities**.

As the program prepared to release its **Controlled Tier dataset**, an urgent need emerged—before researchers could access sensitive participant data, they had to **demonstrate a clear understanding of their ethical responsibilities**. While traditional human-subject research training was available, many researchers viewed these courses as **bureaucratic obligations rather than meaningful learning experiences**.

🔹 **The challenge:** How do we turn compliance training into an **engaging, thought-provoking experience** that challenges researchers to **think critically about ethical decision-making**—rather than just memorizing policy rules?

## ✅ The Solution: A Transformational Learning Approach to Research Ethics

Instead of relying on **policy checklists**, this training explored the **real-world pressures, biases, and justifications** that contribute to **ethical lapses in research**. By shifting the focus from compliance to **ethical reasoning**, we helped researchers **develop strategies to uphold integrity in their work**, reinforcing the **importance of participant trust and responsible data use**.

---

## ✏️ My Role

🎯 Led collaboration with **NIH, IRBs, and research compliance teams** to align training with **federal regulations and program policies**  
🎯 Designed a **tiered learning curriculum** covering **foundational research ethics** to **Controlled Tier-specific policies**  
🎯 Developed **case-based learning scenarios** to reinforce **ethical decision-making**  
🎯 Integrated **stakeholder feedback** to refine content based on **real-world research challenges**

## 🧠 Solution & Instructional Design Approach

To ensure the training was **engaging, practical, and aligned with compliance standards**, I structured the program using **progressive learning pathways, scenario-based activities, and accessibility-driven design**.

### ✅ Structure Based on Real-World Pressures, Biases, and Justifications

Explored the **psychological and systemic factors** that can lead researchers to make **unethical decisions**.

### ✅ Scenario-Based Assessment

Used **case studies and interactive decision-making activities** to challenge researchers to apply ethical reasoning in **real-world research situations**.

### ✅ Stakeholder Collaboration for Policy Alignment

- Worked with **NIH research integrity officers** to align training with **federal compliance mandates**.
- Partnered with **Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and bioethicists** to develop **informed consent training**.
