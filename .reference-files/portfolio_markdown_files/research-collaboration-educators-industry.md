# Making Complex Ideas Click: Connecting Researchers, Educators, and Industry Partners

Cutting-edge research is only as impactful as its ability to be understood, applied, and acted upon. Across multiple projects, I have worked as a translator and facilitator, helping **scientists, educators, and industry professionals** understand each other‚Äôs needs, values, and constraints. By taking complex ideas‚Äîfrom **machine learning to scientific collaboration**‚Äîand turning them into **clear, actionable messages**, I have helped researchers connect with **educators, school administrators, industry partners, and students** in meaningful ways.

## Key Projects in Research Communication & Collaboration

### üì¢ Recruiting & Communicating Research to Educators _(Carnegie Mellon: Adaptive Cognitive Tutors Using Machine Learning)_

- **Translated machine learning and adaptive tutoring concepts** into terms that educators could understand, ensuring they saw how the research connected to their classrooms and students.
- Developed **presentations, handouts, and online materials** that reframed technical research language into practical, real-world applications.
- Used **contextualized, non-technical examples** to explain intelligent tutoring, machine learning, and research vs. beta testing, making abstract concepts accessible.
- **Result:** Successfully **recruited nearly 2,000 students** across multiple school districts by making the research clear, relatable, and actionable for decision-makers.

### üéì Explaining Science to Non-Scientists _(Carnegie Mellon: Academic Poster for Industry Partners)_

- Took **dense academic research** on educational games and **reframed it in terms of business impact**, making it compelling for industry leaders and foundations.
- Used **visual storytelling, clear language, and real-world applications** to explain the research in a way that aligned with business priorities‚Äîhelping potential partners see the value of collaboration.
- **Result:** The approach was so successful that **researchers requested my help in refining their other outreach materials.**

### üî¨ Integrating Social & Emotional Learning into Science Games _(Collaborative Process of Scientific Inquiry)_

- Helped **two research teams with conflicting priorities** (science education and social-emotional learning) find common ground.
- Created a **new framework‚ÄîThe Collaborative Process of Scientific Inquiry**, which redefined science as a social process where discoveries build on each other rather than just an isolated method.
- Translated this framework into **game mechanics and level designs**, ensuring that SEL principles were woven into the learning experience in an authentic way.

### ü§ù Facilitating Collaboration in Intelligent Tutoring Systems _(Collaborative Fractions Tutor)_

- Took a **behind-the-scenes AI-driven tutoring system** and made it **understandable to teachers and school leaders** so they could feel confident adopting it.
- Designed **clear, structured presentations** that broke down how the software responded to student mistakes in real time‚Äîexplaining it in terms of **classroom benefits rather than technical functionality.**
- **Bridged the gap** between AI researchers and educators, ensuring both groups understood each other‚Äôs **needs, concerns, and goals.**

## Why It Matters

My work ensures that **research doesn‚Äôt just stay in the lab**‚Äîit reaches the people who can use it. By translating **technical concepts into clear, relatable messaging**, I have helped research teams **engage educators, recruit participants, secure partnerships, and make their findings actionable.**
