Amos has been involved in many projects and operational activities this year that required active application of his instructional design
expertise and knowledge of Human Centered Design. He supported the interview, selection and onboarding of two new Instructional
Designers; developed and implemented plans for the first NAPC Consortium training beta test for Genetics 101 and first learner
satisfaction survey for Consortium training; worked collaboratively within the ID team to successfully update and re-launch an Annual
Consortium Member Training, and an asynchronous course to support the All of Us Racial Equity Consciousness Institute; lead
development of a Genetics 102 training that is set to launch at the end of June; and numerous infrastructure projects, all of which resulted
in high quality products and outputs that have contributed to a successful first year of the new NAPC grant.

Amos' role regularly requires him to interact with other NAPC staff and All of Us partners to support training development and
implementation. This year as we onboarded new IIDs, Amos has established additional channels for communication to ensure regular
opportunities for sharing and collaborating on training development, including NNLM IDs for more open collaboration. When establishing
relationships with new partners this year, including the GCR and Peds IPT, he expertly guided training consultations to understand their
needs and goals, while setting realistic expectations about what could be accomplished, and advocating for best practices.

Amos is very familiar with the objectives of our organization, and readily takes action and suggests improvements to ensure that we meet
our goals. This year, as gray areas of responsibility between the ID and Instructional Technologist roles persisted, he took the lead in
working with the former Instructional Technology Manager to begin developing hand-off procedures for operational clarity. He
communicates openly when he has questions about projects or workflows, such as how the Idea Factory will support program goals in
light of recent changes, and he regularly shares his ideas for how to improve approaches within the team, for clarity and efficiency.

With an expanded ID team, a part of Amos' role is working collaboratively with leadership to assign projects and tasks to the other
Instructional Designers, and supporting them throughout the development process. This includes helping them to make decisions about
the scope, design, content, and other aspects that impact the learning experience and how effectively new trainings will meet the needs of
our intended audiences. His consultations have been instrumental in improving several pieces of work this year as the new IDs are still
becoming familiar with the needs of NAPC and All of Us.

Amos actively supports our workplace culture that values diversity, equity and inclusion. He utilizes inclusive methodologies for product
development including 508 compliance. This spring he worked collaboratively to build an asynchronous course for the All of Us Racial
Equity Consciousness Institute, and lead breakout discussions for several live learning sessions during the institute. He has also
supported an internal NAPC working group to develop a structure and action plan for incorporating HCD and CBPR into program
development activities, to support our goals of working more intentionally with UBR communities.

Amos' persistence in developing high-quality trainings, and making inroads with learning analytics, has been instrumental in the success
of many projects this year and our overall strong start in the first year of a new grant. His experience, expertise and insights are important
to our continued success.

Amos's curricular design, instructional design and development work is consistently of high quality and meets but usually exceeds the projects' established goals and outcomes. 

Amos's exceptional work is well known throughout the NNLM and AoU universe. 

When working with AoU consortium members and the ACT Board or supporting other TEC endeavors, Amos excels in seeking out information to better understand the project's needs and goals, clearly communicates information to inform or gather additional details and actively uses his knowledge and skill sets to enhance and improve plans and outcomes.  

Amos is a generous TEC team member and will jump in when needed- whether that be helping to articulate information, to assist when a colleague may be struggling with an action or task or to provide a "fresh eyes" point of view.  

When working with AoU consortium members and the ACT Board and supporting other TEC initiatives, Amos patience and strong listening skills allow him to thoughtfully adjust his communication skills to create shared understanding to the complexities of instructional design and learning assessment. 

Amos has a strong history of initiating action to solve challenges both internal and external, and stepping in to provide leadership where there may be a void between AoURP and NNLM.   

An example of Amos's ability to initiate action to create improvement within the NNLM AoU National Program, is his work envisioning, planning and leading the National Training Round-table sessions.
 

 Amos manages a full load of planning, consulting and executing high quality work. This is in addition to meetings, preparing documentation and his other responsibilities. Plus the ongoing 2020 changes and pivots with Pitt and AOU during the ongoing Covid-19 protocols and responses.  

 Amos's work demonstrates an attention to detail, strong skill sets and domain knowledge, and ability to accomplish goals and meet deadlines. His work is consistency of  high quality, noted both internally and by the variety of high level national groups in which the TEC interacts.   

 Amos conducts work according to the established and approved work schedules and demonstrates professionalism and workplace etiquette. 

 Amos is thorough in gathering knowledge from a variety of sources along with synthesizing information to find opportunity, solve challenges or create next steps.  He is also well versed in successfully involving others, internally and externally, when appropriate. 

 Collaborating with NIH scientists, NNLM leadership and other who know little about learning theory, instructional design and the importance of clear,consistent communication and the responsibility of partnership input is a very difficult task. Amos never fails to presents a positive disposition and maintains constructive interpersonal communication when under pressure or stress. 

 Amos continues to be a very important part of the HSLS TEC team, is both a hard worker and a supportive team member and contributes much to the TEC's continued success. 

2022 will provide many opportunities and challenges - those that are planned and those that  present themselves in the moment. I have no doubt that Amos will approached each situation with enthusiasm, a willingness to learn, offered suggestion for improvement and actions plans. 
 

 Amos has grown new skills this year to support his role as Instructional Design Manager, including admin/developer-level knowledge of
Absorb LMS to support the migration of courses and assets from Moodle, and earning a consulting certificate from ATD after growing new
knowledge on consultation practices, which will be applied to future NAPC training requests. He also supported the interview and selection
of a new Instructional Designer, redeveloped two researcher trainings, redesigned the Annual Consortium Member training, updated the
HealthPro Admin training, and contributed to the development of five additional trainings lead by other members of the ID team. Amos
continues to produce a high quality of work and meets expected timelines.

Amos maintains his relationships across NAPC and All of Us. This year he implemented and lead weekly ID team meetings to align
activities with NAPC quarterly goals, and create space for discussion and co-working amongst the IDs. He is building a rapport with our
three new team members, particularly with the Instructional Technology Manager throughout the migration to Absorb to address course
development challenges and identify best approaches. He also continues to actively participate in the ACT Board, NAPC internal meetings
and training consultations with external partners, and communicates regularly with the other IDs to review and consult on their projects.

Amos regularly seeks opportunities to improve our organizational operations and identify short and long term needs for growth. Over the
last year he has advocated for more standardized and efficient approaches to training consultation, including growing his own skills and
obtaining a certificate to support that need. Similarly, he regularly evaluates new products to identify opportunities for enhancing
development, including tools for learning experience design and project management. He has also raised the challenge of evaluating the
impact of training on our audiences and seeks to adjust our measures and approaches where possible.

Amos continues working collaboratively with leadership to assign projects and tasks across the ID team, and supports them through the
development process by consulting about the scope, design, content and other aspects of training development projects they lead. This
year he regularly supported decision making throughout the migration to Absorb on aspects of course development, learner experiences
and admin/developer experiences. In the coming year he will lead the ID team to develop detailed end-to-end documentation for the
NAPC Instructional Design process, to establish standardized approaches and grow our internal support resources as we devote more
capacity toward Consortium and researcher training development.

Amos actively supports our workplace culture that values diversity, equity and inclusion. He utilizes inclusive methodologies for product
development including 508 compliance. He has also conducted QA review on trainings migrated to the new Absorb LMS, and other
aspects of the user interface as it was developed, to ensure quality of user experience.

Amos' collaborative approach to project development and instructional design provides a strong foundation for the ID team. He is flexible
in supporting the needs of our program and his colleagues as they shift, but also continues cultivating the long-term outlook for growth and
direction of our training development processes to support the needs of All of Us. He is a valued member of our team.
