# Play-Based STEM Curriculum: Supporting the Growth of a Leading STEAM Franchise

Hands-on learning is one of the most effective ways to engage young learners in STEM and engineering concepts. When **Snapology**, now the No. 1 childrenâ€™s **STEM/STEAM franchise**, was still in its early years, I developed **Lego-based STEM learning modules** that introduced children to **engineering, physics, and scientific problem-solving** through play.

## The Challenge

Traditional STEM education often relies on **abstract explanations** that can feel disconnected from real-world applications. The goal of this curriculum was to:

ðŸ”¹ **Engage children** in hands-on problem-solving by integrating **Lego-based challenges** that encourage experimentation and discovery.  
ðŸ”¹ **Introduce engineering and physics concepts** through **building, testing, and iteration**, rather than passive instruction.  
ðŸ”¹ **Provide instructors with structured lesson plans** that ensure **consistency across locations and instructors**, making it easier to scale.

## The Solution

I designed **structured yet flexible STEM learning experiences**, helping Snapology create **highly engaging, inquiry-based lessons** that could be replicated and adapted across locations. The curriculum included:

### âœ… Structural Engineering Activities

Encouraging students to **build towers, bridges, and weight-bearing structures** to learn about **stability, balance, and load distribution**.

### âœ… Simple Machines & Mechanical Advantage

Using **gears, pulleys, and levers** to introduce students to **force, motion, and efficiency**.

### âœ… Problem-Solving & Inquiry-Based Learning

Designed challenges where students **tested solutions, refined their designs, and iterated**â€”mirroring the **engineering design process**.

## Impact & Growth

Since its founding in 2010, **Snapology has grown into the top-ranked childrenâ€™s STEM franchise**, expanding to **over 180 locations internationally**. By **2023**, it was recognized as one of **Entrepreneurâ€™s Fastest-Growing Franchises**, doubling franchise signings and opening **21 new locations**.

The **structured, engaging learning experiences** I helped develop in its early years contributed to the **strong educational foundation** that has supported this **rapid growth and success**.

## Why It Matters

By integrating **play-based STEM education** into a **structured curriculum**, I helped create **engaging, scalable learning experiences** that continue to impact **thousands of children** through Snapologyâ€™s growing franchise network.

This project highlights my ability to **design STEM learning that is interactive, scalable, and engaging**â€”helping organizations expand while maintaining **high-quality educational experiences**.
