# Turning Play into Learning: Game-Based Instructional Design

Educational games provide an opportunity to engage learners, reinforce scientific concepts, and promote discovery-based learning. Across multiple projects, I have designed and developed games that use instructional strategies, interactive problem-solving, and scaffolded learning mechanics to teach scientific principles and critical thinking skills.

## Bridging Disciplines: Scientists & Entertainment Technology Experts

One of my most important contributions to these projects was bridging the gap between two very different groups:

üîπ **Scientists and experts**‚Äîincluding cognitive psychologists, human-computer interaction researchers, and learning scientists who provided insights into how people learn.  
üîπ **Entertainment technology practitioners**‚Äîincluding artists, coders, and UX specialists responsible for making the game engaging, interactive, and visually compelling.

I served as the translator and facilitator, ensuring both groups:

- Understood each other‚Äôs priorities, constraints, and expertise.
- Worked toward the same instructional and engagement goals.
- Aligned the game mechanics with evidence-based learning strategies.

This role was critical in ensuring that each game was not just fun but also scientifically grounded and instructionally sound.

### üå± Beanstalk: Teaching the Principles of Balance

Designed game mechanics and levels for **Beanstalk**, a physics-based game that helps young learners discover the laws of balance through interactive problem-solving.

- Worked with scientists to identify common misconceptions about balance and ensure they were addressed through game mechanics.
- Partnered with entertainment technology teams to ensure gameplay remained engaging while reinforcing key learning concepts.
- Designed non-player characters (NPCs) that provided scaffolded guidance to struggling players.

### üèó Rumble Blocks: Building Strong Structures

Assisted in level design for **Rumble Blocks**, a physics-based game where young learners experiment with structural stability while helping an alien build a launch platform for a spaceship.

- Ensured collaboration between learning scientists and game developers, aligning instructional goals with game mechanics that reinforced engineering principles.
- Created progressive challenge levels, ensuring students gradually built an understanding of stability and weight distribution.

### ‚öñ Torque-It: Exploring Balance & Scientific Discovery

Designed game mechanics and instructional strategies for **Torque-It**, a game that teaches students about balance, weight distribution, and the scientific process.

- Helped scientists and game developers align their goals, ensuring both engagement and scientific rigor in the design.
- Designed a visual notebook feature that recorded player actions, allowing students to reflect on their experiments and apply the scientific method.

## Why It Matters

By bridging the gap between experts in science and experts in game development, I helped create learning experiences that were engaging, instructionally sound, and scientifically valid. These projects demonstrate the power of collaboration across disciplines, showing that educational games can be both effective learning tools and compelling interactive experiences.
